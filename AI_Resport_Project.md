* **Metadata Extraction**: Captures file metadata (e.g., creation date, file name) for organizational purposes.  
* **Retry Mechanism**: Allows re-upload if the initial attempt fails due to network issues or file corruption.

In the "Resume PDF Upload" step, after logging in, the user is prompted to upload their resume, which serves as the foundational input for all subsequent enhancement processes. While the system is primarily designed to handle resumes in PDF format, it has been expanded to support a variety of file types commonly used for resumes, ensuring flexibility and accessibility for users. The supported formats include:

* **PDF (.pdf)**: The default and preferred format, requiring no conversion.  
* **Microsoft Word (.docx, .doc)**: Widely used formats for editable resumes.  
* **Rich Text Format (.rtf)**: A cross-platform text format often used for basic formatting.  
* **OpenDocument Text (.odt)**: An open-source format supported by tools like LibreOffice.  
* **Plain Text (.txt)**: A simple, unformatted text option.  
* **HTML (.html)**: Occasionally used for web-based or styled resumes.

To maintain consistency across the enhancement workflow, the system automatically converts any non-PDF file into PDF format upon upload. This conversion leverages reliable tools and libraries—such as python-docx for DOCX files, LibreOffice for RTF and ODT, or wkhtmltopdf for HTML—to preserve the original content and formatting as closely as possible. For TXT files, the system applies a standard layout (e.g., Arial font, size 11, with 1-inch margins) during conversion to ensure readability.

#### **Core Features and Handling**

* **File Upload Mechanism**: Users can select and upload their resume from their device through an intuitive interface.  
* **File Validation**: The system checks the file type against the supported list (PDF, DOCX, DOC, RTF, ODT, TXT, HTML) and enforces a size limit of up to 10MB. If a file exceeds this cap or is in an unsupported format (e.g., .jpg), a clear error message is displayed, such as "Only PDF, DOCX, DOC, RTF, ODT, TXT, or HTML files up to 10MB are accepted."  
* **Automatic Conversion**: Non-PDF files are seamlessly converted to PDF, streamlining the process for subsequent steps like feature extraction and scoring.  
* **Database Integration**: The uploaded file—either the original PDF or the converted PDF—is securely stored in a database (e.g., Supabase, MongoDB, or SQL) or a linked storage system. Metadata, such as the original file name, upload timestamp, and storage path, is captured for organizational and version-control purposes.

#### **User Experience Enhancements**

* **Upload Feedback**: A progress bar or status indicator informs the user of the upload and conversion progress, enhancing transparency.  
* **Preview Option**: After upload and conversion (if applicable), the system displays a preview of the resulting PDF. This allows users to visually confirm that the correct resume has been uploaded and that the formatting is intact, reducing the likelihood of processing errors due to incorrect files.  
* **Retry Mechanism**: If the upload fails—due to network issues, file corruption, or conversion errors—the system provides an option to retry, ensuring a smooth experience.

#### **Security and Limitations**

* **Security**: Given the sensitive nature of resume data, the system encrypts files during transmission (using HTTPS) and storage (e.g., AES-256) to protect personal information. Files are stored securely, potentially in a cloud-based storage system like Supabase Storage, with the database holding references rather than the files themselves to optimize performance.  
* **Text-Based Requirement**: For PDF uploads, the system assumes the presence of selectable text. Image-based PDFs (e.g., scanned documents) are not fully supported without additional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, which could be a future enhancement. If an image-based PDF is detected, the user may be prompted to upload a text-selectable version instead.

#### **Additional Considerations**

* **Multi-Page Support**: The system accommodates multi-page resumes, a common feature in PDFs, ensuring all content is processed correctly.  
* **Files with Images**: Some resumes may include embedded images (e.g., candidate photos or company logos). The conversion process preserves these elements in the PDF, though later enhancement steps might suggest removing them for ATS compatibility.
